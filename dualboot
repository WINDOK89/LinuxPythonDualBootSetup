- modify in bios
set password for authentification: Bodgi
disable secure boot
let uefi (strang behavior if intall in legacy mode

- follow the step in the link:
http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2015/11/how-to-install-ubuntu-linux-alongside.html

- at the end of the installation, there won't be an option to continue testing, only reboot is possible

- to get back in test mode, boot again on the key and enter test mode to follow the end of the procedure

- might not be mandatory but we can try boot-repair tool method 2:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair

- if the computer start up still on windows:
in bios:
	set boot passwd : Bodgi
	option below will become available
	set some efi file as trusted
	go to ubuntu and make two settings (grubs and shimx) give them name
	reboot laptop and press f12
	now the two trusted file are available, one of them will start ubuntu
	back there use efi... cmd to put one of the 2 in front but it won't work

- back in bios
	now in the boot option we can put the grub efi file in front
	now at start we got the grub choice to do between ubuntu and windows

##version 2##

- shrink a volume (70Gb is enough) and let it unallocated
- format it (new volume) and than delete it so it is unallocatred again (this make sure there is nothing left on it)

	- "F12 BOOT Menu" ==> "enabled"
	- "set supervision password" ==> "Bodgi"
