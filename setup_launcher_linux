- this is crazy stuff
- this small tutorial shows how to turn a python file into a launcher

1. specify the python version executer
  - at the first line, add "#!/usr/bin/python3.x"
  
2. make the file executable
  - take admin rights
  - go to the folder: "cd /......./myfile.py"
  - enter "chmod +x myfile.py"
  - to be sure its ok, open a terminal, go to the folder file and enter "./myfile.py" --> the programm should run now
  
3. create a .desktop file
  - take admin rights
  - go to "cd /usr/share/applications
  - create the file "nano myfile.desktop"
  - put the following lines in the file:
    [Desktop Entry]
    Type=Application
    Name=myfile
    Icon=PathToIcon+/myicon.jpg
    Path=/......./myfolder   --> very important to setup the temrinal defualt location
    Exec=myterminalcmd -e ./myfile.py    --> myterminalcmd is "lxterminal" in lubuntu, xfce4-terminal in kde, ....
  - Now copy the .desktop file on the desktop and try it, it should work.
